# Control Strategies

## Overview
In this project, I have implemented multiple control strategies, and tested them on an RRBot in Gazebo. The control strategies were implemented in MATLAB, and the RRBot was spawned in Gazebo and controlled with ROS. gazebo_ros_demos package was used to spawn the RRBot. The dynamic model was generated and represented in state-space form, and this model was used as a starting point for imlementing all the control strategies.
